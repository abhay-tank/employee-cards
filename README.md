# employee-cards
A webpage that fetches data from an API and displays employee information using javascript.

We are using grid to display employee cards efficiently.

Employee images are placeholders fetched from Picsum placeholder API "https://picsum.photos/1000".
However user details is fetched from jsonplaceholder API "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users" .
